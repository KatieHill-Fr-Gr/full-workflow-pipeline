Workshop run on 17 March 2026 - Test 2

## Playful ASCII Studio

This app is the "pipeline 3" project in the workshop. It turns pipeline 2's ASCII idea into an interactive editor.

### What it does
- Lets users type text in a textarea.
- Lets users choose one render mode at a time: `figlet` or `cowsay`.
- Shows a full cowsay character list.
- Lets users change text color, background color, and text size.
- Updates preview live as controls change.
